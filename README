GPU_MODE Notes (by Max Rietmann)

src/shared/constants.h:

Change the following settings (for NOISE simulations):

! sources and receivers Z coordinates given directly instead of with depth
  logical, parameter :: USE_SOURCES_RECVS_Z = .true.

! the seismograms are normal to surface
! Z record corresponds to the normal, while E and N are two tangent vectors
! that completes an orthonormal.
  logical, parameter :: EXT_MESH_RECV_NORMAL = .true.
